# SQL Practice — Chinook (PostgreSQL)

This repository contains SQL queries written and executed on the **Chinook sample database** using **PostgreSQL**.

The goal of this repository is to build **strong SQL muscle memory** and demonstrate practical query patterns commonly used in **Data Engineering and Analytics** workflows.
